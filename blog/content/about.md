Hey there! I'm Vishnu. Welcome to my corner of the web where I intend to document my thoughts.

Currently, I'm immersed in building a GenAI platform at Kore.ai. What sets this journey apart is the immediacy - being able to experiment with the latest advancements within hours of their release.

<!-- In this dynamic landscape, I'm venturing into the world of MLOps, recognizing the vital role it plays in deploying and scaling LLMs for real-world applications. This fusion of theoretical knowledge with hands-on implementation forms the core of my approach. -->

Looking ahead, I envision a future where AI seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, unlocking new realms of human potential. As for my role, I aim to be an active participant in these innovations, contributing and learning in equal measure.

## Beyond Tech

When I'm not coding or diving into AI papers, you'll find me exploring the world. Traveling isn't just a hobby; it's a way to gain fresh perspectives and expand my horizons. I believe that a well-rounded view of the world is essential for creativity and innovation.
